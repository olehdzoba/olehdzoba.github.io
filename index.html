					As we are moving toward a technology-rich future, we see the world of sports is evolving by leaps. While
					statistical data has always played a central role in the sports industry, one technology has significantly
					increased the level of audience engagement and strategic gaming. We are talking about Artificial Intelligence
					in Sports.
				</p>
				<p>
					Over the past two decades, Artificial Intelligence has completely transformed the way we consume and analyze
					sports. AI is making the world smarter for athletes, broadcasters, advertisers, and at last the viewers with
					real-time statistics. Not to mention the role of AI in sports forecasting and improved decision making,
					amongst other benefits, is one of the top applications of modern technology.

					In many ways, the bicycle is largely unchanged since the late 19th century. But along the way, there have been
					numerous technological developments that have changed road cycling and the way we ride - many of which are
					still with us today.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here we&sbquo;ll look at the top inventions that have changed the art of cycling for the better, and alongside the
					older tech that has come to define the bikes we ride today, we have also included more recent innovations that
					will continue to shape the sport in the future.
				</p>
				<p>
					Cycling tech is always evolving and, in a short space of time, these innovations have already changed the
					sport - and are set to become even more commonplace in the years to come.

					<h3>Innovations for people with disabilities</h3>

					These assistive technology innovations range from disability-conscious cookware to inclusive dating apps like
					&#34;Glimmer&#34; -- a platform that provides users with a safe space to disclose their disability while connecting
					with like-minded individuals.
				</p>
				<p>
					When it comes to innovations in the world of mobility, securely balanced wheelchairs and rehabilitative adult
					e-tricycles are changing the way those with physical limitations experience movement. While examples like the
					&#34;Scewo&#34; wheelchair make the process of climbing stairs or elevating to grab hard-to-reach objects an easy feat
					for users, the &#34;CERO E-Tricycle&#34; is designed for those suffering from spinal injuries and other similar
					conditions. In addition to helping with mobility, the three-wheeler also allows riders to work out their legs,
					despite of limitations with movement.
				</p>
				<p>
					Additionally, autism-specific smart glasses, automated home decor accessories, and braille art exhibits help
					make the lives of users easier by relying on hands-free and voice-activated technology to work.
