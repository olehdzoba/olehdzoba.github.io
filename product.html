				<h3>1&colon; Global story about the product.</h3>
				<p>
					It was the 1986 World Cup. Argentina was drawing 0-0 with their old enemy, England, in the sweltering Mexican
					heat when the pint-sized Diego Maradona rose with the England goalkeeper to meet a cross. The keeper was the
					favorite to reach the ball—after all, he was able to use his arms. And yet, somehow the impish Maradona sprung
					into the air faster, met the ball with his head—and nodded the ball into the net.
				</p>
			</article>

			<article>
				<h3>2&colon; What problem does this innovation solve?</h3>
				<p>
					Of course, anyone who knows football knows that isn&sbquo;t exactly what happened. From the moment Maradona
					connected with the ball, the England defenders were apoplectic with rage, gesturing to the referee that the
					Argentinian superstar had scored an illegal goal with his hand. Today, such a goal would have been chalked off
					with the use of AI Referees in just a matter of minutes. All big decisions that change the outcomes of games
					would be judged more accurately, the margin for error would be a lot slimmer—and, arguably, controversies
					would be hugely reduced if AI in sports was used.
				</p>
			</article>

				<h3>3&colon; How to use this innovation.</h3>
				<p>
					The AI Referee verdict, based on the model trained on V7, confirmed that: any &#34;contact&#34; with Sterling
					happened 150ms before Denmark would have reached the ball. An AI ref would have still given the penalty to
					England. However— With more camera angles than 2 available for analysis, the outcome may have been different.
					Naturally, ever since sports have existed the outcome of a game has often been influenced by the so-called
					fine margins—line calls in tennis handballs in football, and offensive fouls in the NBA. And for many years,
					thousands of incidents have been called incorrectly by the referees.
				</p>
			</article>

			<article>
				<h3>4&colon; Who is using this innovation.</h3>
				<p>
					The situation has hardly improved over the years. In fact, research shows shows that: Since March 2015 to June
					2018, the NBA viewed 26,822 plays from 1,476 games. In those 4,297 minutes of action, the officials have
					missed or incorrectly called 2,197 plays, or about 8.2&percnt; of all calls reviewed. This amounts to 1.49&percnt; wrong
					decisions in the final minutes of each close game. I know, 1.49&percnt; might not sound like a lot—but in sport, it
					is huge.
				</p>
			</article>

			<article>
				<h3>5&colon; What can you expect from the service this company is delivering.</h3>
				<p>
					It can be the deciding factor between a team winning or losing, especially in a game like NBA where matches
					often go right down to the wire. Every point matters—and every refereeing call matters. Sport is at the point
					now where it&sbquo;s ready to embrace AI, not to change the outcome of sporting events necessarily, but to improve
					the decision-making process. Offside detection from overhead cameras, for example, can assist VAR in football
					to ensure goals are not correctly or incorrectly given or denied, while on-field tracking systems can detect
					tennis balls so that line calls are judged more accurately.
				</p>

				<h3>6&colon; Future from this innovation.</h3>
				<p>
					Computer Vision can also assist in identifying potential penalties across sports so as to reduce mistakes,
					controversies and prevent games from swaying one way or another due to a poor refereeing decision. Goal-line
					technology, meanwhile, was brought into football after England was denied a clear equalizer versus Germany at
					the 2010 World Cup. As per FIFA&sbquo;s definition, it is &#34;a technical means of instantly determining whether the
					whole of the ball has crossed the line.&#34;
